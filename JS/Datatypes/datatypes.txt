Datatypes: Datatypes are used to define the type of data .there are primarily two types of data types available
i.primitive Datatypes
ii.Non-primitive Datatypes

primitive Datatype: primitive Datatypes are used to store the value directly and these are immutable (can't change)

Non-primitive Datatype; Non-primitive Datatype are used tostore values based on primitive Datatype and these are mutable.these are also called reference datatype 
eg: functions, arrays, objects, etc..,

i. number: any numerical value in js is considered as a number 
eg: let x=25;
    console.log (type of x)

    a. tofixed(noofFractionDigits):it returns new value that got round off per n number of digits after decimal
    eg : let a=25.1463;
    a.tofixed(2); //25.15
    b.tostring(basenumber): it is used to convert number into string and it can also convert number into any based 
    eg:let a+16;
