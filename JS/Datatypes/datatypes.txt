Datatypes: Datatypes are used to define the type of data .there are primarily two types of data types available
i.primitive Datatypes
ii.Non-primitive Datatypes

primitive Datatype: primitive Datatypes are used to store the value directly and these are immutable (can't change)

Non-primitive Datatype; Non-primitive Datatype are used tostore values based on primitive Datatype and these are mutable.these are also called reference datatype 
eg: functions, arrays, objects, etc..,

i. number: any numerical value in js is considered as a number 
eg: let x=25;
    console.log (type of x)

    browser provides some defaulkt methods for numbers such as ,
    a. tofixed(noofFractionDigits):it returns new value that got round off per n number of digits after decimal
    eg : let a=25.1463;
    a.tofixed(2); //25.15
    b.tostring(basenumber): it is used to convert number into string and it can also convert number into any based 
    eg:let a+16;
    a.tostring(2) //'1000'

    Math Methods: 
        These methods are used to mathematical operations using Math class(default)
        i.Math.abs(): It is used to remove negitivity of the values 
        eg: Math.abs(-4) --> 4
        ii.Math.sqrt(): It is used to return the square root of the value 
        eg: Math.sqrt(25) --> 5
        iii.Math.cbrt(): it is used to return the cube root of the value
        eg: Math.cbrt(27) --> 3
        iv.Math.ceil(): It is used to return the upper value (nearest upper interger)
        eg: math.ceil(4.1) --> 5
        v.Math.floor(): It is used to return the lower value (nearest lower interger)
        eg: Math.floor(4.8) --> 4
        vi.Math.round(): It return rounding off to the value 
        eg: Math.round(4.6) --> 5
        vii.Math.random: It returns random value between 0 and 1
        eg: math.random() --> 0.5126
        viii.Math.max(): It return maximum value amoung available
        eg: Math.max(5,6,1,3) --> 6
        ix.Math.min():  It return manimum value amoung available
        eg: Math.max(5,6,1,3) --> 1

        You can use , log , exp , pi ,etc..,

ii. Strings : Strings are used to store alphanumerical values (combination of letters and number )
        Strings can be represented in 3 ways 
        i.single quotation: Strings can represented using single quotations 
        eg: lest s = 'Pavan';

        ii.Double quotes: Strings can represented using double quotations 
        eg: lest s = "Pavan";
        There is no diff between  single or double quotes but can be used inside nested quotes
        eg: let msg = ' The time is 5'0 clock '

        iii.Backtick: Strings
